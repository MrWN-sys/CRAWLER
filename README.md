This is a small project where you can learn how to use Python to scrape information of Douban Top250 Movie, saving as Excel.
This project is suitable for DATA SCRAPING beginner.
In the project I used:
  1. requests (make a request to the web)
  2. BeautifulSoup (scrape information from the web "F12")
  3. FakeUserAgent (random User-Agent prevent banning from request many times)
  4. threading (improve efficiency)
  5. pandas (sort data and write to Excel)

Hope this code can help you, Let's grow up together!!!!!
