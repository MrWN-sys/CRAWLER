This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. All examples use functions and cover the following libraries and techniques:
requests – for making HTTP requests
BeautifulSoup (bs4) – for parsing HTML
etree (lxml) – for XPath parsing
FakeUserAgent (fake_useragent) – for simulating browser requests
pandas – for storing and processing scraped data
threading – for concurrent scraping
Each script demonstrates a different level of complexity, from basic scraping to more advanced, multi-threaded data collection.
